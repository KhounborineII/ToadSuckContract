Paragraph: I will be fulfilling the role of Unit Tester. While we should all be writing unit testing our individual parts, I will cover for any parts of our collective code that has not been tested fully. I will also work with Ryan to organize Beta Testing when the time comes. Since there are five members and six roles that are required, we have decided to split Beta Test organizer between two people. This will allow us to have one person working on the beta test of the earlier version of our app and another with the later version of our app. Given our larger group, I can also ensure we will be able to meet all together as much as possible.

Paragraph: My task is to be a client interfacer, so I will ensure that we are communicating with our client through our product design process. I sent the first email to the five organizations we are working with, which is intended for us to get as much as information on the app our clients need. After this very first meeting, I will ensure that our first prototype is up to the expectation of our client. I will also communicate with our clients to schedule our second meeting after building the first prototype, so we can get feedback from them on what we should add or change. As encouraged by the professor, my group members and I plan to visit the the sites in order to experience what they do.
